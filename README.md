# jsExercises for May 3rd 2016
Today you will be completing exercises `function-exercises.js` and `cs-exercises.js`.

When you think you have completed the function correctly, open `index.html` and preview the file in Cloud9.
`index.html` validates your code and will point out errors if it finds them.
If the test is all green then your function is correct!

## We Do
First, we need to check out the project.

* On this page, click **Fork** in the top right to get your own copy
* Then open up Cloud9. Go to Respositories, find **jsExercises-May3-2016** and click **Clone to edit**.
* Name the Workspace as **jsexercises-may3-2016**, leave all other settings as default and click **Create workspace**.
* Open `function-exercises.js` in your project workspace.

You will notice that the function `example()` is already created for you.
This will serve as a hint on how to complete the rest of the functions.

## You Do
Complete all exercises in `function-exercises.js` then work on `cs-exercises.js`.
The last question in `cs-exercises.js` is intentionally difficult, remember **if you get stuck, ask for help from a mentor!**

You are expected to complete and submit these exercises by the end of this week. Don't waste time!

## Submission
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "jsExercises May-3-2016"
git push origin master
git push origin master:gh-pages
```
